FTP (File Transfer Protocol) can be used to transfer files between a Raspberry Pi and another computer. Although with default program sftp-server of Raspbian the users with sufficient privilege can transfer files or directories, access to the filesystem of the limited users is also required oftenly. Follow the steps below to set up an FTP server:

INSTALL PURE-FTPD

Firstly install Pure-FTPd using the following command line in Terminal:

sudo apt-get install pure-ftpd
BASIC CONFIGURATIONS

We need to creat a new user group named ftpgroup and a new user named ftpuser for FTP users, and make sure this "user" has NO log in privilge and NO home directory:

groupadd ftpgroup;
useradd ftpuser -g ftpgroup -s /sbin/nologin â€“d /dev/null
FTP HOME DIRECTORY, VIRTUAL USER, AND USER GROUP

For instance, make a new directory named FTP for the first user:

sudo mkdir /home/pi/FTP
Make sure the directory is accessable for ftpuser:

sudo chown -R ftpuser:ftpgroup /home/pi/FTP
Create a virtual user named upload, mapping the virtual user to ftpuser and ftpgroup, setting home directory /home/pi/FTP, and record password of the user in database:

sudo pure-pw useradd upload -u ftpuser -g ftpgroup -d /home/pi/FTP -m
A password of that virtual user will be required after this command line is entered. And next, set up a virtual user database by typing:

sudo pure-pw mkdb
Last but not least, define an authentication method by making a link of file /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/PureDB, the number 60 is only for demonstration, make it as small as necessary:

ln -s /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/PureDB /etc/pure-ftpd/auth/60puredb
Restart the program:

sudo service pure-ftpd restart
Test it with an FTP client, like FileZilla.

MORE DETAILED CONFIGURATIONS:

The configuration of Pure-FTPd is simple and intuitive. The administrator only needs to define the necessary settings by making files with option names, like ChrootEveryone, and typing yes, then storing in the directory /etc/pure-ftpd/conf, if all FTP users are to be locked in their FTP home directory (/home/pi/FTP). Here are some recommended settings:

sudo nano /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/ChrootEveryone
Type yes, and press Ctrl+X, Y, and Enter.

Likewise,

make a file named NoAnonymous and type yes;

make a file named AnonymousCantUpload and type yes;

make a file named AnonymousCanCreateDirs and type no;

make a file named DisplayDotFiles and typeno;

make a file named DontResolve and type yes;

make a file named ProhibitDotFilesRead and type yes;

make a file named ProhibitDotFilesWrite and type yes;

make a file named FSCharset and typeUTF-8;

...

Restart pure-ftpd again and apply the above settings.

sudo service pure-ftpd restart
